# Power-BI - Superstore - Dashboard

Power BI Project: Superstore Sales Dashboard

I recently worked on a **Superstore Sales Dashboard** project using **Power BI**, where I transformed raw sales data into an interactive and insightful report.

### What I Did:

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Processed the Superstore dataset to ensure data accuracy and consistency.
* **Dashboard Design**: Built multiple interactive pages for a 360Â° view of sales performance.
* **Visualizations**:

  * Sales analysis across **regions, states, and customer segments**.
  * Performance breakdown by **product categories and sub-categories**.
  * **Monthly & daily sales trends** to uncover seasonality and demand fluctuations.
  * **Top 10 customers** and **top 10 products** contributing the most to profit and revenue.
  * Discount impact analysis, showing how various discount levels affect sales and profitability.
* **KPIs & Metrics**: Designed KPIs to monitor revenue, profit, number of orders, and customer base growth.
* **Interactive Slicers**: Enabled drill-downs by region, state, category, and customer segment for dynamic insights.

### Tools & Skills Used:

* **Power BI Desktop** for building the dashboard.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures and KPIs.
* **Data visualization best practices** to ensure clarity and actionable insights.

### Key Insights:

- West Region has the highest sales and contribute the most to sales, around $725,458 sales are coming from this region.
- In the month of Novemeber, the overall sales are at peak as compared to other months.
- Technology category items contribute the most to sales, 36% of sales are coming from this category overall.
- Customers are divided by three segments; Consumer, Corporate, and Home office, and among them Consumer category customers contribute the most to sales and 51% of sales are contributed by this segment so for future sales.
- Sub-category **Binders** contribute the most to the profit and around $107,243 profit is gained by this sub-category items/products.
- Monday and Friday are two days on which we have the most number of customers/orders and sum of sales. We should offer some discounts on these days to attract more customers.
